# Employee Attrition 

Employee attrition analysis is a type of behavioural analysis where we study the behaviour and characteristics of the employees who left the organization .
A high rate of attrition of employees can be expensive for any company in terms of recruitment and training costs, loss of productivity and morale reduction of employees. By identifying the causes of attrition, a company can take measures to reduce the attrition of employees and maintain precious employees.
